This repository includes code to handle a specific case of missing data. In this case, x has missing values and their missingness is not completely at random: it depends on y. After examining how this type of missingness affects the predictions of x and y, the code then imputes missing values by using the observed relationship between x and y. Finally, the predictions after imputation are compared with the initial full-data predictions.
